# ðŸ“’ Notes

These 14 days cover essential programming topics needed to complete the [100 Days of SwiftUI Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)

It focuses on:

- Using MacOs Playground to create a basic code editor for getting started
- Variables
- Arrays, dictionaries, sets, enums
- if, conditionals, loops
- functions, parameters, error handling
- closures, computed properties, methods
- classes, inheritance
- protocols, optionals

## General reminders

- Swift Playground can be launched via Xcode, through File menu and choosing New > Playground > macOs > blank
- Swift is camelCase
- lets are constants, var are changeable variables
- 

## Toughest quiz questions

## Code snippets to remember

```swift
import Foundation

var greeting = "Hello, playground"

print(greeting + "y'all, yeehaw!")
```
